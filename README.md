# programs_search
##script that searches for installed programs


Sometimes I install programs and I may forget about them ... and I believe it can happen to anyone

Maybe I remember a substring of the program's name, but not the extact name/entire string

So I wrote a very simple script, that gets as input the name, or a part of it, and searches for possible matches

I have only tested it on Arch and Debian distros, because these are the ones I use

I will probably add more distros in the future

So, without further ado ... Happy searching for forgotten programs xD
